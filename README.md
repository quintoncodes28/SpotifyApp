# Lineuptify – Spotify Lineup Web App ⚾🎧

Lineuptify turns your Spotify listening history into a **9-player baseball lineup**.

It pulls your recent plays, scores each track with a custom “HIv2” index, and places songs into field positions based on performance — like a sabermetrics view of your music.

## 🚀 Live Demo

Frontend (Next.js on Vercel):  
**https://spotify-app-six-nu.vercel.app**

Backend (FastAPI on Render):  
**https://lineuptify.onrender.com/healthz**

> Note: The app is currently configured as a **single-user demo** (my Spotify account).  
> It is portfolio-ready but not a public multi-user SaaS.

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. **Spotify Login (OAuth)**
1. User clicks **Sign in with Spotify**
2. Redirects to Spotify's login page
3. Spotify sends user back to `/callback` with an authorization code
4. The backend exchanges the code for tokens

### 2. **Data Ingestion (`logger_recent.py`)**
Fetches & stores:
- recently played tracks  
- artists  
- albums  
- track → artist mappings  
- saved-track flags  

Writes everything into **SQLite (`data.db`)**.

### 3. **HIv2 Scoring**
Weighted index using:
- 30-day play count (35%)
- 7-day momentum (20%)
- track popularity (15%)
- artist clout (10%)
- recency (10%)
- saved-track affinity (7%)
- diversity (3%)

Creates one score per track.

### 4. **Lineup Builder**
Assigns top-scoring tracks to baseball positions:
- CF, LF, RF  
- SS, 2B, 3B, 1B  
- C, P  

Returns:
- lineup[]
- star player
- team profile metadata
- snapshot timestamp

### 5. **Frontend Visualization**
- Baseball-style lineup card
- Actual baseball field with player avatars
- Current vs Legends mode
- Refresh button (reruns logger)
